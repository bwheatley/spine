- Proper exception handling
- keys with metadata which can be used to declare then in both hierarchical and non-hierachical ways
- track additional metadata about keys like sourcefile and sourceline
- better release publisher
- gut Data.pm:
  - Non-filesystem backend
  - queriable/contexts
- File deletion
- Make class_overlay MUCH more generic
