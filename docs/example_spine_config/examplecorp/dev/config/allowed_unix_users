# Here you might add dev leads as root. Assuming you've setup AUTH, and you
# have an authgroup called devleads, you could do this:
#root:@devleads
#
# You migh talso want to give all devs access to the dev user, and if you
# have a role defined called dev, and a authgroup called devteam, that would look
# like this
#dev:@devteam
